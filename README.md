# Passport Authentication Project

This is a web application demonstrating user registration and login functionality using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Passport.js for authentication. It is styled using Bootstrap with a Bootswatch theme for enhanced visuals. It served well as a weekend project and gave me hands-on experience with Node.js and Bootstrap!
